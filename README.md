# AirPollutionEstimation
# The toolbox was based on Python script. PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations can be estimated by importing Landsat8 images.
# PM2.5:
# Set workspace: input a folder path to save output data
# Boundary: input a path of polygon feature layer of study area. The study area of test data is Delhi (India). https://github.com/datameet/Municipal_Spatial_Data/blob/master/Delhi/Delhi_Boundary-SHP.zip
# NumberOfMosaicImages: input how many satellite images will be mosaicked. In test data, Delhi is covered by 2 Landsat 8 images ---path146row40 and path147row40, so this parameter is 2.
